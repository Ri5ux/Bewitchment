Their hatred is strong enough at times to rip them into the mortal plane, putting livestock at their mercy. Despite their ferocity, they are at the low ranks of demonic echelons. It is said they can be milked, similar to snakes of the overworld, but the resultant substance is foul and full of hatred."
